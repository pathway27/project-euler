 Problem 1
-----------
Simplifying the maths will result in a much more efficient program.
The key of this problem has to deal with series (sums of sequences),
rather than divisibility.

We require the sum of numbers in $$ [1, 999] $$ which are divisible
by $$5$$ or $$3$$. 

So, the series of numbers divisble by 5 in $$ [1 , 999] $$
  $$ 5 + 10 + 15 + ... + 995 = 5 [1 + 2 + ... + 119 ] $$
Similarly for 3,
  $$ 3 + 9 + 12 + ... + 999 = 3 [1 + 2 + ... + 333 ] $$
